## "an attempt at the world's most complicated sticky note program"

Firstly.

This is released into the public domain.

No warranty is provided, implied or otherwise.

To re-iterate the previous sentence, any usage of this program is entirely your responsibility.

Instructions:

    1. Clone the common, JavaSE and target application repositories.
    2. Build the common, JavaSE and application repositories in that order.
    3. Run the application repository.

If using IDEA, run the idea generation on all three repositories seperately,
 then open IDEA on the application repository and fix up the dependencies.

Do something similar with your Eclipse workspace if you use Eclipse,
 only now you don't have to be careful as to open the application first,
 or repeat some of the steps for every application being edited.

(This is as simple a system as I could work out.)
