The Grand List Of Assumptions

1. If a RubyIO is edited, the relevant SchemaPath, or a parent of it, must be informed somehow.
 (Try to avoid calling "too high", especially near "Deity-Objects" named things like "Database")
2. The RPGCommand system makes a few assumptions which only RPG Maker-series engines can fulfill, and RGSS engines in particular.
   @code is always the command code, and is always an integer.
   @indent is always the indentation. (Or indentation is not supported.)
   @parameters is always the parameters array.
   (Other values can be added, but must be referred to via schemas with X-commands to be noticed.)
   Command buffers bypass the restrictions, but are more complicated to use as a result.
3. A map is always made of square tiles.
4. If it is in hashVal.keySet(), it is immutable. Backends can assume this, for memory reasons.
5. Events are grid-aligned.
6. Various things are easier to do if you have RubyTables.
7. This is a MINOR assumption, but do *try* to keep AMAI (Automatically Modified Array Index) in sync in any class that handles "that kind of object".
