 I don't even know if I'll go through with this yet.
 Also note that the information given is because I don't know how much the routines will cover yet,
  so I'm giving the detected engine version of the game used for testing.
 In other news, I'm going to have to institute a 'Shift-JIS at all times' policy on handling this game's files,
  to prevent corruption...

 YES! Moved from Class 1 to Class 0 support at 1:21:00 17 Feb GMT.
 (In retrospect, it was moved too early, perhaps. Oh well. Things SHOULD be... within boundaries, now,
   or I wouldn't have moved this out of secretService.)

 The support for the Studio Pixel "Ikachan" engine is partially a test to ensure
  that the program is sufficiently modular for any further work.
 (Think 'MV'.)

 Mostly useless - but maybe move the syntax docs in RXP here.
 Serves as a simple example.
