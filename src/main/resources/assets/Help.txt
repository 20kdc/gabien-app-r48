0: Index
. This is the guide to R48, a sticky note editor.
. (And map editor for the freeware game "Ikachan" by Studio Pixel. Feature creep.)
.
. Firstly, keep in mind that text fields will revert unless you press enter.
. The same goes for number fields.
. This is critical to several operations.
.
. Secondly, make sure you ran this program from the same directory as whatever you want to edit.
.
. Third, make sure that you've selected that game at the first menu.
. If not, closing both this help window and the main window should bring you back there.
.
. At the top, directly under the "Save modified files" button, there should be some tabs.
. The tab names should describe what they do, but in any case, for further detail, see the below pages:
.
> 4 System Objects
> 5 ObjectDB Monitor
> 6 System Tools
. (The below are only applicable for map editing.)
> 1 Map
> 2 MapInfos
> 3 Tools
. Note that to ensure your work is saved, remember to press the button at the top-right to save your work.
. Furthermore, keep backups. :)

1: Map
i HelpImg/1.diagram.png
. 'Map' is the map editor.
. From this, you can do many things.
. However, first, you need to know controls.
. Dragging with the Right Mouse Button allows panning about the map.
. This is crucial for even basic datamining operations.
. Clicking with the Left Mouse Button will use the current tool, or if no tool is running, will bring up a dialogue box to select one.
> 7 Map Tools
. Pressing the "m" button will toggle a minimap.
. This allows faster navigation of the map, or reading messages written with tiles.
. At the bottom-left, there are the Layer Tabs.
. These allow the selection of a tile layer, and hiding/showing layers.
. To hide/show a layer, right click on it's tab.
. To select a layer, left-click on it's tab, so long as it's a tile layer.
. The selected tile layer only matters to the tools which need to know it.
. The "E" and "P" layers are not tile layers, but instead are placeholders.
. These layers allow hiding/showing Events and the Panorama, respectively.

2: MapInfos
. This is the grand list of maps for editing.
. Keep in mind that some "maps" may not actually be maps,
. but may be dummy entries for organization.
. These maps are structured in a hierarchy.
. To select a map, click on it's name.
. When a map is selected, buttons will appear to the right for movement.
. Maps can be created and deleted with this tool.
. Be careful.

3: Tools
. Like System Tools later, this contains debugging functions.
. They should not need to be used under normal circumstances,
. and have the potential to cause havoc.
. However, these functions are less... generic, than the ones in System Tools.
> 0 Back to the Index.

4: System Objects
. If there is a tab to edit an object, it is safer to edit it using that tab.
. But failing that:
. This allows editing the various bits and pieces that nobody would ever write a dedicated editor for, so the generic layout system was used.
. (At least you can edit it, right?)
. A description of each object would take forever to write.
. This, however, gives some general details.

5: ObjectDB Monitor
. This keeps track of what files are loaded in memory.
. Not much more can be said, since that's all it does.
> 0 Back to the Index.

6: System Tools
. This contains various functions for debugging, testing, and sanity maintenance.
. They're here because I may need them, more than anything else.
> 0 Back to the Index.

7: Map Tools
. This would not be very much of an editor if maps were not editable.
. The "Map Tools" dialogue box exists to help you achieve this.
i HelpImg/7.example.png
. As you can see, several tools exist.
. For general usage, "Tiles", and "Event List", should be enough.
. For access to the BGS/BGM, map resize, and other map pieces, use Edit Direct.

8: Tiles
i HelpImg/need-image.png
. This allows the editing of the map's tiles.
. The "stride" of the tileset depends on the window's width.
. Clicking on a tile in the map will paste it in.
. An area of the tileset can be selected, and it will be interpreted based on the window's width, when the tiles are pasted in.
> 7 Back to the Map Tools.

9: Event List
. This is a rather simple tool to use.
. Opening it will show circles at the positions of events.
. Clicking a tile will report all events at that position, and give the option to create a new event there, delete one of the existing events, or move an event.
.
. There is only one thing to note about Ikachan events:
. Ikachan events are best learned by experimentation, as the meanings of, say, the target offset parameters, aren't consistent between NPC types.

10: How To Resize A Map
. Note before continuing:
. All tile data is destroyed by this operation.
. If you save afterwards, the data can only be restored from backup.
. Step 1. Click "Edit Direct.".
. Step 2. Select "@data".
. Step 3. Edit the width/height to the right (Below the 3 target tile numbers).
. Step 4. Click "Resize".

12: Object Editing Details
. The "Schema" system for editing objects is meant to be usable.
. However, it does not make things easy.
.
. Beforehand, a reminder.
. Text fields will revert unless you press enter.
. The same goes for number fields.
.
. Now that emphasis is over, here's the notes.
.
. Firstly:
. To the left is generally the field name, to the right is generally the field data.
. They are split by a line which should be visible between them.
. The field name is not usually editable.
.
. Secondly, the top (not the title) bar does many things.
. It shows the object you're currently using.
. You can use "Insp." for raw inspection.
. This is usually useless on backends other than 'r48' (RGSS).
. ".." lets you go back a level, and "Save" does what you'd expect.
. The "Cp." and "Ps." buttons allow copying and pasting a part, so long as it's relatively valid, from one place to another.
. The system will try to correct any obviously wrong details.
. The copy and paste applies to the object being viewed, not the currently selected field or any details.
.
. Thirdly, if an object ends with a bunch of one-letter buttons, this means it can be one of several types, and clicking those buttons resets it with a type.
.
. I hope this is enough information to work with.

  Don't believe me? Swap out the Java class files yourself in an OSOR.)
