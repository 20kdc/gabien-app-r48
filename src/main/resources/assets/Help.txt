i HelpImg/0.demo.png
. Greetings. I, am 20kdc. This is your guide to R48.
.
. Firstly, keep in mind that text fields will revert unless you press enter.
. The same goes for number fields.
. This is critical to several operations.
.
. Secondly, make sure you ran this program from the same directory as the game that you want to edit.
.
. Third, make sure that you've selected that game at the first menu.
. If not, closing both this help window and the main window should bring you back there.
.
. Moving this help window out of the way, the picture on the right should match.
. The tab names should describe what they do, but in any case, for further detail, see the below pages:
> 1 Map
> 2 MapInfos
> 3 Tools
> 4 System Objects
> 5 ObjectDB Monitor
> 6 System Tools
. Note that to ensure your work is saved, remember to press the button at the top-right to save your work.
. Furthermore, keep backups. :)

1: Map
i HelpImg/1.diagram.png
. 'Map' is the map editor.
. From this, you can do many things.
. However, first, you need to know controls.
. Dragging with the Right Mouse Button allows panning about the map.
. This is crucial for even basic datamining operations.
. Clicking with the Left Mouse Button will use the current tool, or if no tool is running, will bring up a dialogue box to select one.
> 7 Map Tools
. Pressing the "m" button will toggle a minimap.
. This allows faster navigation of the map, or reading messages written with tiles.
. At the bottom-left, there are the Layer Tabs.
. These allow the selection of a tile layer, and hiding/showing layers.
. To hide/show a layer, right click on it's tab.
. To select a layer, left-click on it's tab, so long as it's a tile layer.
. The selected tile layer only matters to the tools which need to know it.
. The "E" and "P" layers are not tile layers, but instead are placeholders.
. These layers allow hiding/showing Events and the Panorama, respectively.

2: MapInfos
. This is the grand list of maps for editing.
. Keep in mind that some "maps" may not actually be maps,
. but may be dummy entries for organization.
. These maps are structured in a hierarchy.
. To select a map, click on it's name.
. When a map is selected, buttons will appear to the right for movement.
. Maps can be created and deleted with this tool.
. Be careful.
> 0 Back to the Index.

3: Tools
. Like System Tools later, this contains debugging functions.
. They should not need to be used under normal circumstances,
. and have the potential to cause havoc.
. However, these functions are less... generic, than the ones in System Tools.
> 0 Back to the Index.

4: System Objects
. If there is a tab to edit an object, it is safer to edit it using that tab.
. But failing that:
. This allows editing the various bits and pieces that nobody would ever write a dedicated editor for, so the generic layout system was used.
. (At least you can edit it, right?)
. A description of each object would take forever to write.
. This, however, gives some general details.

5: ObjectDB Monitor
. This keeps track of what files are loaded in memory.
. Not much more can be said, since that's all it does.
> 0 Back to the Index.

6: System Tools
. This contains various functions for debugging, testing, and sanity maintenance.
. They're here because I may need them, more than anything else.
> 0 Back to the Index.

7: Map Tools
. This would not be very much of an editor if maps were not editable.
. The "Map Tools" dialogue box exists to help you achieve this.
i HelpImg/7.example.png
. As you can see, several tools exist.
. For general usage, "Tiles", and "Event List", should be enough.
. For access to the BGS/BGM, map resize, and other map pieces, use Edit Direct.

> 9 Event List
> 10 How To Resize A Map
> 1 Back to the Map.

8: Tiles
i HelpImg/need-image.png
. This allows the editing of the map's tiles.
. The "stride" of the tileset depends on the window's width.
. Clicking on a tile in the map will paste it in.
. An area of the tileset can be selected, and it will be interpreted based on the window's width, when the tiles are pasted in.
> 7 Back to the Map Tools.

9: Event List
. This is a rather simple tool to use.
. Opening it will show circles at the positions of events.
. Clicking a tile will report all events at that position, and give the option to create a new event there, delete one of the existing events, or move an event.

10: How To Resize A Map
. Note before continuing:
. All tile data is destroyed by this operation.
. If you save afterwards, the data can only be restored from backup.
. Step 1. Click "Edit Direct.".
. Step 2. Select "@data".
. Step 3. Edit the width/height to the right (Below the 3 target tile numbers).
. Step 4. Click "Resize".
> 7 Back to the Map Tools.

11: Event Editing Details
. Before I note anything else, this depends on the game.
. However, all events have two fields in common: @x and @y.
. These fields are used to specify the position of the event in the map.
. No matter how the specific engine does things, the toolset relies on these fields being in place.
.
. The general structure of objects should always be kept in mind when editing.
> 12 Object Editing Details
.
. Game-specific documentation files:
> 13 Ikachan Events
> 14 RGSS (RXP, RVXA) Events Overview
. Assuming there are schemas for all the commands (RVXA users take note), you should be able to use them by looking at the Ruby interpreter scripts as documentation.
> 9 Back to the Event List guide.

12: Object Editing Details
. The "Schema" system for editing objects is meant to be usable.
. However, it does not make things easy.
.
. Beforehand, a reminder.
. Text fields will revert unless you press enter.
. The same goes for number fields.
.
. Now that emphasis is over, here's the notes.
.
. Firstly:
. To the left is generally the field name, to the right is generally the field data.
. They are split by a line which should be visible between them.
. The field name is not usually editable.
.
. Secondly, the top (not the title) bar does many things.
. It shows the object you're currently using.
. You can use "Insp." for raw inspection.
. This is usually useless on backends other than 'r48' (RGSS).
. ".." lets you go back a level, and "Save" does what you'd expect.
. The "Cp." and "Ps." buttons allow copying and pasting a part, so long as it's relatively valid, from one place to another.
. The system will try to correct any obviously wrong details.
. The copy and paste applies to the object being viewed, not the currently selected field or any details.
.
. Thirdly, if an object ends with a bunch of one-letter buttons, this means it can be one of several types, and clicking those buttons resets it with a type.
.
. I hope this is enough information to work with.

13: Ikachan Events
. There is only one thing to note about Ikachan events:
. Ikachan events are best learned by experimentation, as the meanings of, say, the target offset parameters, aren't consistent between NPC types.
> 11 Event Editing Details

14: RGSS Events (Overview)
. RGSS, or the 'Ruby Game Scripting System', is. in essence a generic 2D game engine that uses Ruby.
. Nothing much about it - it leaves a lot up to the Ruby scripts, short of some tilemap rendering details and such.
. In practice, RPG Maker itself follows specific patterns, and for users, these patterns are law.
.
. Firstly, @name is a useless field.
. @id is just a reference to the parent ID and cannot be used.
. @x and @y are the position.
. @pages is the array of pages - each page is a possible state for the event to be in.
.
. A page has, among other things:
. A @condition, which specifies when this page should be shown.
. I am unsure which page "wins" if more than one is valid - I would presume it is the last.
. A @through flag, which specifies if the event can be walked through.
. A @move_route, which specifies the sequence of movements the event performs in this page.
> 15 RGSS Events (Moveroutes)
. A @move_type, @move_frequency and @move_speed, which specify how the event moves.
. @step_anime and @walk_anime flags, which enable/disable step/walk animations.
. A @priority_type, which sets a setting I don't quite understand. (VXA)
. A @direction_fix flag - if true, the event will NOT face towards the player on interaction.
. A @trigger, dictating what causes the page code to execute.
> 16 A @list of commands.
> 17 A @graphic to show the event in-world.
> 11 Index Page Of Event Editing Details

15: RGSS Events (Moveroutes)
. Like EventCommands, except without indentation.
> 14 Back to RGSS Events (Overview)

16: RGSS Events (EventCommands)
. EventCommands are the bread and butter of how you actually write any dialogue into a RPG Maker game.
. They also change so much between versions that to describe them all in here would be ridiculously complicated.
. You'll just have to guess.
.
. To change the type, click on the command, then click on the command type at the top.
.
. A consistent thing to note is that "MoveRoute Editor Helper NOP" or such are absolutely ignored in-game.
. The 'Insert Point' is also ignored in-game.
.

17: RGSS Events (Graphics)
. Graphics are used to display an Event in the world.
. Interestingly, RVXA has less features than RXP in this regard - it has no support for hue modulation.
. Graphics have a @pattern, indicating the X position within the event.
. Graphics have a @tile_id, which should be 0 unless you want the graphic to be from the map tileset.
. Graphics have a @direction, which indicates the direction of the event. (This is linked to the Y position.)
. Finally, graphics have a @character_name (and @character_index or @character_hue depending on version).
. This specifies the actual image to get the character from.
