 (highly incomplete) database schema

: RPG::Tileset
C name Class.RPG::Tileset @name | Tileset: #A
@name string
@tileset_name string
 This is kind of important:
 The highpass data is obvious, lowpass/TID not so much.
 Lowpass/TID allocation is:

 0 through 17 is the special bunch, divided into these groups:

 0-3:
  0: 0-999 set.
  1: 1000-1999 set.
  2: 2000-2999 set.
  3: 3000-3049 set.
 4-5:
  4: 3050-3099 set.
  5: 3100-3149 set.
  (With out of range IDs this could extend further)
 6-17: 4000-4599 set, divided into 50s, I think
  (With out of range IDs this could extend further)

 18-161 is the 5000-5143 set.
