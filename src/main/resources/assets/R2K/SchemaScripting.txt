 Defining EventCommandEditor triggers RMTools, DO NOT DO THAT!
 Now for an explaination.
 LcfEventCommandEditor is a full schema element which acts as RPG::EventCommand.
 LcfEventCommandEditor_Most is what the user will see if no command is defined.
 RPG::EventCommand is the *conveniently completely invisible* schema being used for modifyVal.
 Which means it can do whatever it likes, including, say, slight misuse of a 1-based indexer.
 arrayIx1 DOES NOT CARE about element 0, outside of making it nil if it would otherwise be a VM-incompatible value (Actual Java NULL).
 Next, ]0 text string will reinitialize it and make sure the first is a string.
 arrayIx1 will ensure the rest are all ints.
 Thus, it should be impossible to generate unserializable data.
 ...Meanwhile, LcfEventCommandEditor_Most gets it the other way around, since it's for user display, so text should be at the top.
