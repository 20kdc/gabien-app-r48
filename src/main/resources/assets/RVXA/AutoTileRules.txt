 Ok, so I tried implementing this logic sanely,
  but it didn't work out.
 So I reimplemented it using a set of rules.
 But the rules right now are non-configurable.
 Time to fix that.
 Format of numbers is CCi, where C is the actual display index (what AutoTiles corner IDs get mapped to),
  and i is the 0-3 index used in rendering.

 So, essentially: TileNumber on CornerIndex implies <true ANums> and <false ANums>.

 Essentially, this is a table that lets you work out
  what surrounds an AutoTile from how it's composited.
 (For a primer on that, see AutoTiles.txt)
 That is then brute-force-translated with the aid of the main ATDB,
  in order to get a simple surroundings -> autotile index table.

 If there are multiple valid outcomes, the tile will be 47'd.
 This usually means you need to add more rules.
 Or the database broke.

 (NOTE: Despite this file being way bigger than a binary table, it's also easier to understand. Kinda.
  I keep copies of the reference charts on every section for a reason.)

 Just some basic rules for tiles 0, 2 and 7.
 1. Tile 0 always means that the orthogonal directions it's pointing at aren't connected.
    (Diagonal directions are ignored, for obvious enough reasons.)
 2. Tile 2 means that the orthogonal directions *are* connected,
     and furthermore, due to the "notch" it is certain the diagonal is NOT connected.
 3. Tile 7 means both orthogonals and diagonal are connected.
