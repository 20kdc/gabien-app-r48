 VX Ace Enemy Battle Actions Helpfile
 "The Bat Theme Continues" (this is the 3rd Batfile)

0: None
.
. No condition applies!
. For lack of a better place, I'll explain the rating system here, to my understanding.
. Imagine there is a line, with the rating of highest *valid* rated action at the top, and that number minus 3 at the bottom.
. For rating purposes, the highest rating minus 3 is considered "0", so the variance is between "0" (max minus 3) and "3" (max).
. Furthermore, all actions with a rating <= "0" are culled early.
. So, to force an action, it would simply have to have a rating 3 more than any other action.
. This is important if you want an action to always be performed under certain conditions without a random chance of anything else.
.
. @param1: Useless.
. @param2: Also useless.
.

1: Turns Passed
.
. If @param2 is 0, this is simple:
. On turn @param1, run this action.
.
. If @param2 isn't 0, this becomes more complicated.
. Essentially, the battle is divided into blocks of @param2 turns.
. @param1 should be between 0 and (@param2 - 1).
. Also, this will never happen if the turn count is 0.
.
. @param1: Turn number.
. @param2: Turn block size (or 0 for this to only happen once)
.

2: HP Check
.
. This checks if the HP, divided by the max HP, is between param1 and param2.
. Note that they should be decimals ('f') between 0.0 and 1.0.
.
. @param1: Lower bound
. @param2: Upper bound
.

3: MP Check
.
. This checks if the MP, divided by the max MP, is between param1 and param2.
. Note that they should be decimals between 0.0 and 1.0.
.
. @param1: Lower bound
. @param2: Upper bound
.

4: State Check
.
. This checks if the enemy has a given state.
.
. @param1: State ID.
. @param2: No meaning.
.

5: Highest level in party is >=...
.
. This checks if the player's party has any members above a level.
.
. @param1: Level.
. @param2: No meaning.
.

6: Switch On
.
. This checks if a switch is on.
.
. @param1: Switch ID
