from highest priority to lowest:
+ finish full 2k3 editor (Done)
+ eventually turn editor into huge gelatinous monstrosity (Working on it)

OSLoc & IMI:

  Run everything via testing.
  IMI's gone through critical path testing.
  2k/2k3 save file editing is currently "hidden".
+ v0.8
+ 2k/2k3 save-edit (thank you, Ghabry)
+ v0.9
+ R48-as-2k/2k3-save-editor is a massive benefit by itself and raises awareness
+ UI improvements driven by influx due to save editing ???
+ Bugfixes, really
