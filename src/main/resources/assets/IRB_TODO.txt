from highest priority to lowest:
+ finish full 2k3 editor (Done)
+ eventually turn editor into huge gelatinous monstrosity (Working on it)

OSLoc, IMI:
 OSLoc was a failure and will be removed by v1.0
 IMI may be a failure???

short-term planning subsection:
  Run everything via testing.
  This includes the Android build.
  This *particularly* includes the Android build.
  IMI's gone through critical path testing.
  2k/2k3 save file editing is currently "hidden".
+ v0.8
  (RELEASE DATE: 10th of December.
   I'm building this early, then running through testing after I sleep.
   If I don't find anything I'll use this build, otherwise it's frantic debugging.
   I'm getting this release out to that I can finish save-edit for v0.9
    and then do whatever for v1.0 (or nothing at all)
  )
+ ask easyrpg about what is up with SaveSystem system_box_tiling
+ send back SavePicture default value fixes, they probably need this
+ 2k/2k3 save-edit (thank you, Ghabry)
+ Fixing encoding issues is still in-between r/n (FormatSyntax is assuming system encoding, not UTF-8, when given internal strings - makes sense, but bad),
   need to actually bring :encoding in to really fix everything
+ checkup on TilesetTableSchemaElement
  <IMMEDIATELY BEGIN INFORMAL RELEASE-TESTING>
+ v0.9
  (LATEST RELEASE DATE: 20th of December.)
+ Bugfixes.
  This is very much a "what did I break this time" release.
  The Android UX needs testing.
- Remove OSLoc and maybe IMI, which I'll rename the WAU.
  Icky, kind of cancerous...
+ v1.0
  (RELEASE DATE: 27th of December, basically.
   This time last year was when R48 started.)
+ Since this is now past the stable release,
   possibly change the way everything refers to everything.
  Definitely figure out how to make it so every schema path has a path-from-root-object,
   which must be totally reliable *or* completely fail.
  If this means abstracting SchemaPaths some more and removing RubyIO target it'll have to be done.
  Plus, this will mean magical bindings become *less* hacky, if they can be represented.
+ If that's done,
   definitely definitely keep a shadow copy of every ObjectDB value that's loaded,
   and definitely definitely add an undo button.
+ v1.1

- ANYTIME -
+ Responding to anything Cherry thinks up next
  (the original note was written because of 2k3 1.12, in case it's text seemed suspicious)
