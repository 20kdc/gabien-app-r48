from highest priority to lowest:
+ finish full 2k3 editor (Done)
+ eventually turn editor into huge gelatinous monstrosity (Working on it)

short-term planning subsection:
+ Project OSLoc:
  OneShot localization files, as a prelude to IMI release
+ Project IMI:
  Usage as follows:
  1. Firstly, zip up all other assets that have changed (these must not include Data/ files)
     explaination for OSD:
     "If you have changed any of the graphics or audio (but *not* Data - R48 will handle that),
       put those folders into a ZIP."
     "(making sure that, *after* you open the ZIP, you see, for example, 'Graphics',
       and that you only see the contents of that folder by going a level deeper)"
     "Then, remove all files within the ZIP that you haven't changed."
  2. Secondly, compile with "Compile IMI Data".
     This will ask you for the location of an unmodified copy of the game.
     Without this, R48 cannot work out what has changed.
     R48 will then compile the IMI datafile.
  3. User runs IMI installer 'blank'. This will either find the output files, and create the IMI installer,
      or complain about something.
+ v0.8
+ 2k save-edit (thank you, Ghabry)
+ v0.9
+ R48-as-2k/2k3-save-editor is a massive benefit by itself and raises awareness
+ UI improvements driven by influx due to save editing.
+ v1.0

- ANYTIME -
+ Anything Cherry thinks up next
