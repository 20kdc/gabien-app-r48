from highest priority to lowest:
+ finish full 2k3 editor (Done)
+ eventually turn editor into huge gelatinous monstrosity (Working on it)

short-term planning:
+ USABILITY-HIGH
 + command-trees
 + all the XP things
+ USABILITY-MID
 + DB2
   + Borrow from JSON tokenizer
   + Use ';' as a line-ender?
   + Generally less line-oriented and messy

+ USABILITY-LOW
 + immortal window export
 + clean up windowing?

+ Figure out RXP's oddities(???)

+ send back SavePicture default value fixes, they probably need this (Well, I did mention it, but if anything's happened I don't see it)

- Maybe remove IMI, which I'll rename the WAU.
  Icky, kind of cancerous...
