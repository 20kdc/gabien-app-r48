from highest priority to lowest:
+ finish full 2k3 editor (Done)
+ eventually turn editor into huge gelatinous monstrosity (Working on it)

short-term planning:
+ SHAKESPEARE
 + Hash auto-increment for simple integers
 + Character creator???
 + 2k/2k3 template select
 + Image editor refactor [IN PROGRESS]
 + Camera button changes to make how it works clearer

+ CORE-MAINTAIN

+ USABILITY-HIGH
 + command-trees [DONE?]
 + all the XP things [SOMEWHAT-DONE?]

+ USABILITY-MID
 + SDB1.1 Rollout [PARTIAL]
 + SDB Further Documentation Project
  + Should create a useful index to help clean up SDB

+ Figure out RXP's oddities(???)

+ send back SavePicture default value fixes, they probably need this (Well, I did mention it, but if anything's happened I don't see it)

- Maybe remove IMI, which I'll rename the WAU.
  Icky, kind of cancerous...
