from highest priority to lowest:
+ finish full 2k3 editor (Done)
+ eventually turn editor into huge gelatinous monstrosity (Working on it)

short-term planning:
+ USABILITY-HIGH
 + command-trees
 + all the XP things
+ USABILITY-MID
 + "SDB1.1"
  - SDB2 scrapped, would cause major rewriting for no good reason
  + Keep using SDB2 "Sane Path Syntax" groundwork
  + DBLoader tokenizer tries to preserve compatibility by making " only applicable at the start of a word
   + Magically applies to TXDB - Check if this is a good thing, if it is, keep doing it
    + Are Java & JSON escapes sufficiently compatible? If so, great, TXDB just got better with no added work
  + Semi-incompatible extension to DB1 format
  + Can be immediately put to use.
  + Format changes can still occur via slow progression as per usual,
     rather than a big change that will break everything
  + Should serve as an example of how format changes should occur in R48
  + "C sdb1.1" enables SDB1.1 features in a specific SDB file during transition period
   + SDB1.1 PathSyntax, ValueSyntax, DisambiguatorSyntax
    etc.
 + SDB Further Documentation Project
  + Should create a useful index to help clean up SDB

+ Figure out RXP's oddities(???)

+ send back SavePicture default value fixes, they probably need this (Well, I did mention it, but if anything's happened I don't see it)

- Maybe remove IMI, which I'll rename the WAU.
  Icky, kind of cancerous...
