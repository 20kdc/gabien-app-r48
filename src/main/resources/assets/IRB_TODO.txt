from highest priority to lowest:
+ finish full 2k3 editor
+ eventually turn editor into huge gelatinous monstrosity

short-term planning subsection:
+ Finish spritesheet stuff (VXA!)
+ Make a 'colour effects' sprite cache
+ Use this to implement hues & tones
+ Add blendmodes to gabien API for the "scale & rotate" routine (And only for that, since it's a routine that's meant to be "does anything but is slow")
+ Then use that everywhere it's supposed to be used
