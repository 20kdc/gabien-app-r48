 THE GLOBAL SCHEMA FILE (this text moved from RXP schema)
 commands:
  ']' Use only if this object is an array - indexes the array.
      Use in any context that happens to also be an array, lastArray isn't a thing anymore.
      This will ensure the target is an array if it isn't already.
  ':' Define object class.
  '.' Define substructure.
  '@' Instance var.
  '+' Append directly to aggregate. (Needed for some less often-used things that need to be attached, see table*)
  '>' Alias.
  'e' Enum. First argument is type ID, then alternating integer and text-word.
   e blah 1 Box 2 Circle 3 Rectangle
  's' Symbolic Enum. (enum using Ruby Symbols). First argument is type ID, rest of the arguments are symbols.
   s blah :box :circle :rectangle
  'E' Enum with text on the int-entry button. First argument is type ID, second is button text-word, then the alternating integer and text-word.
   E level LevelID 0 Zombies 1 Piranhas 2 FourHorsemenOfThePocalips
  'M' Merges two enums at the end of each frame (after dictionaries).
      This is useful for cases where you have a dictionary, and then some special values.
      (character_id)
  ']' Array index (shorthand for "+]<index>", basically)
      Use only in a proper array context (it will check!!!)
  'i' include file
  'D', 'd': Dictionary definitions (moved from hardcoding to make inter-engine porting potentially easier.)
   'D' refers to a dictionary where elements contain names.
   'd' refers to a dictionary where elements directly equal names.
    Examples are probably the simplest thing at this point...

    Firstly, Tilesets here is an ObjectDB array. Nothing around it, just a raw array referred to by a file,
     containing objects with the instance variable "@name".

     D internal_tilesetDictionary Tilesets 0 @name

    Note that "Tilesets" could be extended with instance variables, like this R2K example referring to "@map_infos", a hash (hence 1) in RPG_RT.lmt:

     D internal_mapDictionary RPG_RT.lmt@map_infos 1 @name

    Applied to the existing example, that would be:

     D internal_tilesetDictionary Tilesets@some_array 0 @name

    And now for 'd'-syntax, which is different and always refers to arrays.

     d internal_elementDictionary System @elements

     This refers to the instance variable @elements of System, as an array of strings.

  'A' Install AutoTiles files.
   The autotiles system works with a set of autotiles definitions, which must be installed.
  'C' Random stuff (allowIndentControl, name definitions..., access to the super special schema that only works for a given structure...)
