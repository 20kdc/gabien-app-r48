 AutotileDB
 This is used for editing & rendering autotiles.
 The first character dictates line type.
 I believe this was the first use of the 'text database' format in this project,
  and one of the important very early parts of it.
 Anyway. 'd' is the upper, and 'D' the lower, line.
 These lines have two corner parameters, giving a 2x2 grid.
 This grid represents how RPG Maker renders AutoTiles.

 On this grid, the values, here shown in their places on the AT image,
  are used.

  A | |B
  --+-+--
  UL|U|UR
  --+-+--
  L |C|R
  --+-+--
  LL|D|LR

 This layout has not changed much since RPG Maker 2003.
 In RPG Maker VX Ace, it is condensed, but the rules still follow.
 Image offsets are halved so that 'U' is actually part of UL and part of UR,
  and such - this is more efficient in space and a little less ambiguous.

 The idea, however, is the same - 4 corners on each tile sampled from the AT image.
