 NOTE: This apparently does nothing (not even defined),
       it seems to be solely an assist for RPG Maker XP itself
       the structure is, firstly the 209, which counts it's own first command,
       then one 509 for each *additional* command.
       The first 509 contains the entire MoveRoute list.
       From a screenshot, the editor apparently looks like this:

       Set event route: This event
                        Turn Left
                        Turn Right
                        Do a dance
       >>

       the actual truth of the matter, and the terminating NOP, being abstracted away.
