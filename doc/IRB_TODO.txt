GOAL 1. The Biggest Problem With R48, Part 3
+ Try to remove/reduce FormatSyntax dynamic name routine dispatch
  This is in prep. for conversion to DTC
  + In general, the goal is to remove parameterSchemas/getParameterDisplaySchemaFromArray
  + Perhaps try to compile-in getParameterDisplaySchemaFromArray calls for more detailed checking?
    Would allow pointing at specific problem sites i.e. name routines that would change behaviour
    Fix those and then drop calls to getParameterDisplaySchemaFromArray entirely

GOAL 2. The Biggest Problem With R48, Part 4
+ Successfully port every CMDB command name.
+ Drop support for unported command names.

-- DELAYED --

honestly all of this stuff is eternally delayed

+ Map looping support
 (ok tbh this is probably not happening
  and if it was happening, it'd probably be tiles only)
+ Helpfile rewrite

+ Demetrius's various notes over IRC and such:
 + Nicer pattern-tiling map editing similar to the way paste works in the image editor
 + Image editor palette cleanup ( #51 )
 + Character creator??? [in progress]

+ OSLoc mode improvements, perhaps?
  nope, just nope, just nope, just nope.

+ Documentation
 + SDB Further Documentation Project ???
  + Should create a useful index to help clean up SDB

+ Figure out RXP's oddities(???)

+ send back SavePicture default value fixes, they probably need this (Well, I did mention it, but if anything's happened I don't see it)
 + Check this again on both sides!!!
