GOAL 1. The Biggest Problem With R48
+ Introduce a fancy new prefix for CMDB command names for them to be run on MiniVM.
+ Successfully port every CMDB command name.
+ Drop support for unported command names.
+ Remove the prefix and error if the prefix is received.
+ Successfully de-prefix every CMDB command name.
+ Rather than loading FormatSyntax into MVM slots, do things the sensible way instead.

-- DELAYED --

honestly all of this stuff is eternally delayed

+ Map looping support
 (ok tbh this is probably not happening
  and if it was happening, it'd probably be tiles only)
+ Helpfile rewrite

+ Demetrius's various notes over IRC and such:
 + Nicer pattern-tiling map editing similar to the way paste works in the image editor
 + Image editor palette cleanup ( #51 )
 + Character creator??? [in progress]

+ OSLoc mode improvements, perhaps?
  nope, just nope, just nope, just nope.

+ Documentation
 + SDB Further Documentation Project ???
  + Should create a useful index to help clean up SDB

+ Figure out RXP's oddities(???)

+ send back SavePicture default value fixes, they probably need this (Well, I did mention it, but if anything's happened I don't see it)
 + Check this again on both sides!!!
