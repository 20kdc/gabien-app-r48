# MVM Guide

The "Definitely not a Scheme VM", aka MiniVM, aka MVM, is being used for an increasing number of functions in R48.

This guide to it is split into three sections:

* "R48's Red Book", `vm-details.md`, detailing MVM (the inner workings).

* "R48's Green Book", `dmvm.md`, detailing D/MVM (the language).

* "R48's Blue Book", which doesn't exist, but would contain all the outer library stuff. Maybe try `(help-html)`?
