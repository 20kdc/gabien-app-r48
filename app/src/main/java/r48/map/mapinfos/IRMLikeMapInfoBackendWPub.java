/**
 * Attempting to bridge the gap between RXP+ and R2k's map info systems so the same UI code can be used.
 * Plan here is to abstract all of RMMapInfos's complicated shifting-about code away,
 * then make it work on RXP, then make it work on R2k.
 * All relevant GUMs are assumed to have their own map ID.
 * However, not all map IDs must have GUMs.
 * Created on 02/06/17.
