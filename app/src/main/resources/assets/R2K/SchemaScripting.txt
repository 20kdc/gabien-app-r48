 Weird undocumented 'feature' : -1 teleports party...
 Thanks to Ghabry for finding out and notifying me about this:
 <Ghabry> t20kdc: That's some implementation detail Cherry explained to me. Because the "Change Vehicle Command" checks if the party is in the affected vehicle and in that case moves the party, too. When the Party has no vehicle she has the vehicle ID -1. So "-1" results in the party being moved.

 Now for an explanation.
 RPG::EventCommand is the 'skeleton' schema element used to build event commands & is used for modifyVal.
 EventCommandEditor_Most is what the user will see if no command is defined.
 There's also a version of the schema entirely generated by the schema system itself used for known commands.

 EventListEditor is responsible for the entire command editing UI.

 Regarding EventCommandParams:
 It's the visual representation of unknown command arguments.
 So it's ESSENTIALLY the Schema-side UI for an arbitrary ParameterArray instance.
 arrayIx1 DOES NOT CARE about element 0, outside of making it nil if it would otherwise be an actual Java null.
 (NOT THAT THIS SHOULD HAPPEN UNDER DM2.)
 Next, ]0 text string will reinitialize it and make sure the first is a string.
 arrayIx1 will ensure the rest are all ints.
 Thus, it should be impossible to generate unserializable data.

 Some advice I left earlier was:
 Advice: HAVE A DEBUGGER HANDY IF YOU ARE WRITING SCHEMA STUFF AND GET A ARRAYELEMENTSCHEMAELEMENT ERROR!!!!

 Use the Command Buffer syntax to fix this mess.
 Note that this introduces new and interesting problems, but I claim it's worth it,
  as movecommand_code is used elsewhere(!)

 -Move Commands-

 Used by the move commands to avoid tons of redundant paramspecs

.movecommand_default_nothing
@parameters { ]0 _ string ]1 _ int ]2 _ int ]3 _ int }

: RPG::MoveCommand

@parameters { ]0 _ string ]1 _ int ]2 _ int ]3 _ int }
