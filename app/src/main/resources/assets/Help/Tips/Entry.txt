, While I'm not a lawyer, to my knowledge, if properly followed, the license should not prevent free or paid distribution of your game.
, Though do keep in mind EasyRPG Player has dependencies that may complicate the process.
, It is also possible to use it to play the game via HTML5 Canvas.
, There are some sites that will host these for you.
