, R48 Usage Manual
,
. Welcome to the R48 usage manual.
, R48's interface is essentially a miniature desktop.
p 4
I HelpImg/0.demo.png
p 4
. It's split into the tab bar, with a global 'save' button, and the tab contents.
, Here, no tab is active, so it's a field of blue squares.
, Tabs can be turned into floating windows and back with the window-like-button on them.
, Closable tabs/windows will have a red button on them.
.
. R48 expects text or number field edits to be confirmed by pressing enter.
, Not pressing enter cancels the edit.
.
. The tab names should describe what they do, but in any case, for further detail, see the below pages:
> Help/Main/Toolsets:1 Map
> Help/Main/Toolsets:2 MapInfos
> Help/Main/Toolsets:4 Database Objects
> Help/Main/Toolsets:6 System Tools
.
. Before you continue, if you are just starting out and trying to make something to run on EasyRPG with this, read the following.
> 21 R2k Backend Quickstart
. While if you just want to use this to increase your gold in a 2k/2k3 game (you know who you are)...
> 23 R2k Savefiles Quickstart
.
. Note that to ensure your work is saved, remember to press the button at the top-right to save your work.
, Furthermore, keep backups. :)

21: R2k Backend Quickstart
. RPG Maker 2000/2003 is, as you probably know, emulated by the (unrelated to me) open-source EasyRPG Player project.
. As RPG Maker 2000/2003 does not have any Core Scripts to deal with, it means that with a full editor, games can be created from scratch.
. Step 1. Create a blank folder.
. Step 2. In the folder, create the folders "\"ChipSet\"" and "\"System\"". (capitalization is important.)
. Step 3. Extract assets/R2K/templatetileset.png from this JAR (it's a ZIP file) and put it in ChipSet. Do not rename it.
. Step 4. Extract assets/R2K/System.png from this JAR (it's a ZIP file) and put it in System. Do not rename it.
. Step 5. Copy the program JAR into the folder and run it, or alternatively (if you understand how to use Root Path) simply point it there.
. Step 6. Once you select RPG Maker 2000/2003, there should be 3 modified files, and the screen showing up should contain a grid flashing between different colours.
. Step 7. Save all modified files, and begin work. You will need a knowledge of how RPG Maker 2000/2003 games are structured to continue, but it should work.
.
. Particularly Common Operations:
> Help/Main/Toolsets:2 To manage maps, check the MapInfos tab.
. The start location of the player and vehicles is stored in Database Objects / RPG_RT.lmt.
.
. General Structure:
. RPG_RT.ldb and RPG_RT.lmt: Data files used to run the game.
. RPG_RT.ini: Optional and not handled by R48. Starts with the line "\"[RPG_RT]\"," and ought to contain "\"GameTitle=your title here\"".
. Backdrop: Battle background images. 320x240. Non-transparent?
. Battle: Animation images. 480x480, 96x96 per cel.
. Battle2: RPG Maker 2003 larger animation images. 640x640, 128x128 per cel.
. BattleCharSet: Player party images. (This is probably 2003-only.) 144x384, 48x48 per image, one character per row.
. BattleWeapon: Weapons used for attack animations. (This is probably 2003-only.)
> 19 CharSet: Event, player and vehicle images. 288x256.
. ChipSet: Tilesets. The best way to understand this is probably to look at the template and experiment. 480x256.
. FaceSet: Faces. 192x192 total, 48x48 for each face.
. Frame: Don't use this, really. Just use a Picture. 320x240.
. GameOver: 320x240 images for Game Over.
. Monster: Enemy images. Can be any size.
. Music: Music, in various formats.
. Panorama: For the "\"parallax\"" fields. Non-transparent? (Accurate parallax emulation in an editor is impossible due to it being gameplay-dependant)
. Picture: Arbitrary images to be shown on screen using specific commands.
. Sound: Sound effects for various things.
> 22 System: Alters the general appearance of system frames and text. 160x80.
. System2: For things used in RPG Maker 2003. 80x96.
. Title: Title screen images. 320x240.

22: R2k Backend 'System' Explaination
. The "\"System\"" images are 160x80, and follow a complex layout.
. The bottom 32 pixels are 16x16 colour swabs for text rendering.
. The 4th is used for disabled items, the 5th is used to mean "\"critical\"," and the 6th means dead.
. The 10th, meanwhile, is used for healing actions.
. The next highest 16 pixels are broken unevenly into 16 pieces.
. Horizontally, these are:
. 16 pixels: Main Background Swab
. 16 pixels: Main Shadow Swab
. 8 pixels times 10: Digits 0 to 9
. 8 pixels: ':'
. 8 pixels: Unused (or maybe space)
. 16 pixels: Shadow Large
. 16 pixels: Shadow Small
. The remaining 32 vertical pixels are broken into 4.
. 32 pixels: Window Frame Swab (can be stretched or tiled depending on RPG::System settings)
. 32 pixels: Frame (outer 8 pixel border) and arrows (inner 16x16 pixels block split in 2, up arrow being upper)
. 32 pixels: Selection Frame, animation frame 1
. 32 pixels: Selection Frame, animation frame 2
. 32 pixels: This is further split into 4 8-pixel wide frames of 4 8-pixel high change indicators.
. From the top of the indicators, these are "\"positive\"," "\"same\"," "\"negative\"," and a "\"E\"" (Equipped?).

23: R2k Savefiles Quickstart
. There are many RPG Maker 2000/2003 games out there. That's a fact at this point.
. And there are quite a few people, (maybe including you, as you're reading this!) who want to edit savefiles in these games.
. Unfortunately, a RPG Maker 2000/2003 savefile is rather complicated! But that won't be an issue.
. The Saves panel lets you load or create savefiles.
. Creating a savefile is experimental, but should bring you to the start of the game, allowing you to inject items you shouldn't have, adjust actors, etc. from the very start.
. Savefiles are shown in the Map panel.
. Most of this simply acts as a display, though - the details are in '...' -> 'Properties'.
. Let's start with the basic outline...
. @title : Defines how this savefile appears in the Load menu.
. @system : Defines various RPG_RT.ldb@system details.
. @actors : Contains experience, skills, battle commands (if applicable) of actors.
. @party : Contains party members, the items list, gold, timers, and some generic stats.
. @party_pos (accessible as the "\"Party\"" event on-world): The current player position and details.
. @boat_pos (if party's on the same map, accessible as "\"Boat\""): The boat's position & details.
. @ship_pos (if party's on the same map, accessible as "\"Ship\""): The ship's position & details.
. @airship_pos (if party's on the same map, accessible as "\"Airship\""): The airship's position & details.
. @target : Used by the Teleport event. Note that it seems a fake target is sometimes added by RPG_RT.
. @map_info : Contains details from the MapInfo entry regarding this map, tile remaps, events, and parallax info.
. @screen : Contains information on global screen effects. Some of this is uncertain (contact EasyRPG with your findings, they'll tell me).
. @pictures : Maps Picture IDs to their information.
. @main_interpreter : The Interpreter used for non-parallel event code.
. @common_events : The Interpreters of common events.
. Reset Events & Version : Using this will delete all events from the savefile and add in the map's events and set the save-counts.
. Using it and then removing a particular event *should* allow you to bypass event obstacles, though note that some events may stop working entirely simply by it's use.
. If you simply want to reliably teleport the player, use the next button:
. Try To Get RPG_RT To Reset The Map (not shown) : Tries to get RPG_RT to reset the map by setting this as an older save and getting rid of event info.
. This is incredibly useful if you intend to teleport yourself across maps and *don't* wish to disturb events at your destination.
. Note that all events will be converted to ghosts.
.
. Regarding what I mean by a "\"ghost\"" here, a "\"ghost\"" is what I'm calling events which will appear in the map that aren't in the save.
. R48 detects when ghosts are likely to occur and show them - and lets you put them in the savefile!
. But this is done in the same way as Reset Events, so... possibly unreliable.

801: The Help Format
. The help format is a simple markup format.
. It is meant for easy, fast layout.
. It uses the normal DB format, divided into sections with the usual numbered-object-creation syntax.
. For example, "\"801: The Help Format\"" begins page 801.
. Pages should, but do not have to be, ordered.
. The following 'commands' exist:
. '.': Create a label. Automatic word-break is always on, but line-break also occurs.
. 'h': Like '.', but centred.
. ',': Adds a line break and more text to the previous label.
. 'p': Generate some amount (given as a number) of blank space.
.
. The following two commands draw images.
. They take either one parameter (the image filename) or five parameters (image filename, X, Y, width, height.)
. The five-parameter version is useful if a cropping of an image should be used.
.
. 'i': Draw a image to the right side of the page, with text continuing on the left (Mediawiki-style but with no 'undertext'.)
. 'I': Draw a centred image, useful if you want to draw attention to it / give it a margin.

998: Internal Tool Documentation 'RMAnimEditor'
. Sometimes, you just need to edit a battle animation.
, And you can't do that very easily from the standard interface, though it is possible.
, RMAnimEditor was written for making things easier, but it's kind of weird and doesn't render all cases.
.
. Notably, this only covers the @frames section.
, The rest, including timings, must be edited manually.
, Also keep in mind that the frame numbers displayed are 1-based - timings use a 0-based system, so subtract 1 to get the timing frame.
.
. So, without further ado, the layout:
.
. At the top is the Timeline Bar.
, It allows going between frames ('<', '>', 'Play').
, It allows copying and pasting them ('C', 'P') - pasting overwrites the current frame, it doesn't insert.
, And it allows inserting a copy of the current frame as the next frame ('+'), and removing the current frame ('-').
.
. In the lower-left is the actual Animation View.
, A darkened cross on the background is the "\"zero point\"" - coordinates 0, 0 relative to the animation's point on-screen.
, Right-button-drags across the Animation View will shift it's camera.
, Left-button-drags will change the X/Y position of the currently selected cell.
.
. In the lower right is the Cell View.
, This has two of it's own panels - at the top, it has the properties for the selected cell (or nothing if no cell is selected) - at the bottom, it has the cell list.
, Animations in RPG Maker 2000/2003 do not have keyframes, but R48 simulates keyframed animation anyway.
, As such, each property has a 'keyframe' button. If orange, this is a keyframe; pressing the button will 'delete' it, re-interpolating as necessary.
, A frame is considered a keyframe if it marks a change in the linear progression of the animation.
.
. In particular, changing a property will cause the frames *before and after* to gain keyframe status if they don't have it already.
, This is because the frames *before and after* still retain the old value of the property.
.
. This serves as a hopefully functional toolset for modifying animations.
