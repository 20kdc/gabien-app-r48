1: Map
I HelpImg/1.diagram.png
. 'Map' is the map editor.
, This is how you modify maps, which are 2D tile-based grids on which objects sit.
, What the kind of objects are, how big the tiles are, and such, is specific to the engine.
.
. The controls differ between touchscreen and desktop.
, Touchscreen uses a 'camera button' to allow moving around & zooming; when this is off, touching the map will use the current tool.
, Desktop uses the right mouse button and the mouse wheel.
.
. Dragging with the Right Mouse Button allows panning about the map.
, This is crucial for even basic datamining operations.
, Clicking with the Left Mouse Button will use the current tool, unless no tool is running, in which case it also pans.
.
> Help/Main/MapEdit:7 At the top, a bar is shown. These are the map tools.
.
. At the top left, there are zoom controls, and information on what mouse controls are currently available.

2: MapInfos
i HelpImg/2.hierarchy.png
. This is the grand list of maps for editing.
, Keep in mind that some "\"maps\"" may not actually be maps,
, but may be dummy entries for organization.
.
. These maps are structured in a hierarchy.
, To select a map, click on it's name.
, This will attempt to open the map. (Which may not succeed, leaving you with a blank map and a created object, for now.)
.
. When a map is selected, buttons will appear at the right.
, (One for editing information, and one for moving the map up a level in the hierarchy.)
, To parent a map under another map, simply drag and drop it.
, Maps can be created and deleted with this tool.
, Be careful.

4: Database Objects
. If there is a tab to edit an object, it is safer to edit it using that tab.
, But failing that:
, This allows editing the various bits and pieces that nobody would ever write a dedicated editor for, so the generic layout system was used.
, (At least you can edit it, right?)
, A description of each object would take forever to write.
, This, however, gives some general details.

6: System Tools
. This is the page you first start on when you open R48.
, It's meant to be a quick way to access the various more 'disconnected' parts of R48.
, It's also how I access debug functionality in R48.
