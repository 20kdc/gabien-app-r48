Water animation is the good ol' "waving in and out" animation, 0121.

Waterfalls are a bit tricky.
They fit in a 2x3 AT slot, but they're actually 3 separate AT sets laid out vertically.
The animation is 012.

+ 0x0001:0x1FFF : All tiles
	+ 0x0001:0x07FF : Individual (non-AT) tiles
		+ 0x0001:0x03FF : B/C/D/E - 4 sheets, each sheet containing 256 tiles
			These are TS indices 5, 6, 7, 8
			Each 256-tile sheet is laid out as two 128-tile columns.
			The columns are 8 tiles in width and go down the usual 16 rows.
			VXATileRenderer.handleMTLayer handles this.
		+ 0x0400:0x05FF : Would be part of the above, but the tileset slots don't exist for it.
		+ 0x0600:0x07FF : Sheet A5
			Like the above, but repeats TS index 4 twice. 
	+ 0x0800:0x1FFF : Autotiles
		These are divided into 48-long AT fields.
		These groups of 48 can be using one of three AT field sets, regular, wall, and waterfall.
		+ 0x0800:0x0AFF : Sheet A1 (TS index 0) (16 groups theoretical)
			The sheet is arranged as 8x4 AT sets, 2x3 tiles each.
			Note that coordinates here are given in the AT set grid.
			To help understand this, a diagram of the groups (marked in hex) is at the bottom of this file.
			As for the various groups:
			General: This is best understood as 4 sets in a cycle of 4.
				0...: Regular AT, water animation - x groupNum & 4, y (groupNum >> 3) * 2
				1...: Waterfall AT, 3-frame loop - x 3 + (groupNum & 4), y (groupNum >> 3) * 2
				2/3: Like 0/1 but add 1 to the Y.
			However, there are three "overrides" near the start:
			Group 1: Regular AT, water animation 0,3
			Group 2: Regular AT set 3,0
			Group 3: Regular AT set 3,1
		+ 0x0B00:0x10FF : Sheet A2 (TS index 1) (32 groups theoretical)
			The sheet is arranged as 8x4 regular AT sets, 2x3 tiles each.
			Mapping from group numbers to coordinates is just ordinary row-major.
		+ 0x1100:0x16FF : Sheet A3 (TS index 2) (32 groups theoretical)
			The sheet is arranged as 8x4 wall AT sets, 2x2 tiles each.
			Mapping from group numbers to coordinates is just ordinary row-major.
		+ 0x1700:0x1FFF : Sheet A4 (TS index 3) (48 groups theoretical)
			The sheet is arranged as a row of 8 regular AT sets, followed by a row of 8 wall AT sets.
			This occurs 3 times, making the complete 48 groups.
			The ordering is row-major as usual.
