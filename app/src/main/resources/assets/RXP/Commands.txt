 I've moved the docs on this to IRB_CMDB.txt

 Confirmed Types (incomplete nowadays because of major usability work adding paramassist types):

  int
  string
  string_array
  int_boolean
  int_or_var (alias for int, but the int can have meaning)
  <the gazillion _id types>
  direction (alias for int, but an enum. 2: Down, 4: Left, 6: Right, 8: Up)
  animation_id (alias for int blah blah blah)
  iterate_actor (0 means all, otherwise integer ID.)
  iterate_battler0 (int, complicated)
  iterate_battler1 (int, complicated)

  selfswitch_id (a string with a set default value of "A")

  opacity (int= 255)

  enemy_action_kind (0 Basic 1 Skill 2 Item)
  enemy_action_basic (0 Attack 1 Guard 2 Escape 3 Rest)
  force_action_target (Actor/TroopEnemyID -2 Last -1 Random)

  cms_type (0: panorama, 1: fog, 2: battleback)
  change_text_options_position (0: up 1: middle 2: down)

  conditional_branch_parameters
  change_map_settings_parameters

  weather_type (0: none, 1: rain, 2: storm, 3: snow)

  <fully qualified object classname, "RPG::AudioFile" for example>

 notes:
  operate_value(int_boolean:negate, int_boolean:isVariable, int_or_var:value)

 Basic aliasing is here for convenience (just within the file, and no fancy SchemaDB constructs)

 Completed pages:
  (1-2 are base pages, no commands)
  3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
  (7 is the last page)
 In theory, it's complete.
 Course, there'll probably be schema bugs with all the commands.
 Automated tests are passing for the commands in <test subject name here>.fON
