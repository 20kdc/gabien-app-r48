ValueSyntax is a syntax for describing basic Ruby values
 (specifically all the kinds that you have to worry about disambiguations and such with)
It has six forms:

'$' text... : string (in older versions, this was dependent on "SDB version")
'nil' : nil
'true' : true
'false' : false
':' text... : symbol
text... : integer

PathSyntax is a syntax for getting a RubyIO relative to another RubyIO.
Sometimes, it's used relative to the world.

PathSyntax text is divided into a start block (which may not be allowed to exist in some cases),
 which if allowed is an ObjectDB ID, and a set of path-components,
 which have to start with ':', '@', or ']'.

A path-component continues until the next instance of a path-component start character.
There is a form of escaping applied here: '#' escapes the next character, including another '#'.

Note that a path component may support additions / deletions, or may not.
Retrieval, addition and deletion are marked with "RAD".

The path-component forms are:

':':

   '{' ValueSyntax : Hash value by key. (RAD)
   '.' text...     : Arbitrary (can be non-@) instance variable (RAD)
   'length'        : Array length (R..)
   'fail'          : Always fails. (R..)
   <nothing>       : "self" - NOP.

'@':

   text...         : IVar - the '@' gets included (RAD)

']':

   text...         : Array index integer (RA.)
