 VX Ace Battle Effects Helpfile
 Will be implemented as a miniature help dialog,
  for simplicity and flexibility.
 Notably, due to this, these IDs are also recorded in SchemaFiles.txt as the enum battle_effect_code.
 (Given the interesting nature of this system,
  I don't trust them not to do the same thing,
   which would explain how "Yanfly" has such flexibility.
  Looking from the outside-in, this is as much as I can do.)
