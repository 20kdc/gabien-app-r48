 Just some basic rules for tiles 0, 2 and 7.
 1. Tile 0 always means that the orthogonal directions it's pointing at aren't connected.
    (Diagonal directions are ignored, for obvious enough reasons.)
 2. Tile 2 means that the orthogonal directions *are* connected,
     and furthermore, due to the "notch" it is certain the diagonal is NOT connected.
 3. Tile 7 means both orthogonals and diagonal are connected.

 The next two rule sets are the main rules to handle tiles 3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11.
  The rules on orthogonal (4, 6, 8, 10) tiles are:
  1. The 2 outward-facing corners of an orthogonal tile cannot connect in the direction it "faces".
  2. The 2 outward-facing corners of an orthogonal tile indicate connection *directly adjacent to this corner*.

     To emphasize:

     Let's just assume this is a block of AT corners, the left AT being a left cap,
      and the right AT being a right cap.
     In this case, 2, 3, 6 and 7 meet the criteria.
     Working backwards to reach the rules:
      In order for 2 to be valid, there must be an AT to it's right. To it's left is irrelevant to 2.
      In order for 3 to be valid, there must be an AT to it's left. To it's right is irrelevant to 3.
       (Rule 1.)
      Furthermore, there cannot be anything connecting above 2 for 2 to be valid,
       or anything connecting above 3 for 3 to be valid. (Rule 2.)
      The same applies for 6 and 7.

 The rules on diagonal tiles (3, 5, 9, 11), for the outward-facing corner,
  are the rules for 0.
 You can see from examination that 030 matches 000, and that 051 matches 001.
 For the inward-facing corner on those diagonal tiles, they must be swamped -
  the rules are the same as those for tile 7, only in a different order.

 With the default AutoTiles.txt file, no other rules are needed as far as I can tell -
  these rules resolve perfectly well to the correct tiles.
